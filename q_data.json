        "Questions":"Steps to reproduce the behaviour\nOpen database with an entry A containing the string \"xyz-abc\" (choose as appropriate)\nSearch for xyz AND abc\nEntry A does not appear in the results although it should (it did before the search feature update).\nEntry A will appear in the search results when using xyz abc (which in Lucene implies an OR used).\nHope anybody can reproduce this issue. I found the issue when looking for strings in the \"comments\" field but I tested that the issue should occur with the title field and perhaps other fields as well. The issue does not occur when using \"xyz abc\", so it seems the new search now expects strings to occur as substrings in separate words. I'm using search groups a lot and found that behavior today only because some entries where missing after the search-group migration.\n\nUpdate: It also seems that the new search does not recognise string occurrences in the keywords anymore.\n\nThis is perhaps a matter of taste, but the new search feature exposing Lucene syntax directly to the user feels surprisingly counterintuitive. I'm more familiar with regular expression syntax. But I'm sure I'll adapt. \n\nImplied: Why is It this way? Can It be changed?",
        "Best Human Answer":"#This is perhaps a matter of taste, but the new search feature exposing Lucene syntax directly to the user feels surprisingly counterintuitive. I'm more familiar with regular expression syntax. But I'm sure I'll adapt.\n\nI agree. Lucene search will find match the entry of interest if you search for xyz AND *abc. The explanation is that your search expression needs to match the entire string, from the word boundary to the target, but not necessarily beyond the target. In other words, all Lucene searches would start with ^ if expressed as regex, and the beginning of the string is each token rather than the entire field of interest.\n\nYou can also search with regex, but still need to match the beginning of the word\/token. To do this, just enclose the expression in \/ characters. Now you will get a match for \/.*abc\/, \/...-abc\/, \/.{3}-abc\/, \/.*ab\/, and so on. However, lookahead and look-behind don't seem to work in the search bar so you will just need to include previous or upcoming characters in the expression to constrain the results.\n\n...\n\n#The issue does not occur when using \"xyz abc\", so it seems the new search now expects strings to occur as substrings in separate words.\n\nThis is correct, except that the unit of analysis is not words, per se, but \"tokens\" that happen to contain separate words. The string xyz abc is interpreted as two tokens whereas \"xyz-abc\" is interpreted as one token."

        "Questions":"Context: Above\n\nRegarding the keywords, it seems to work, if the search string is part of the first keyword. But if there are more keywords and the string is only occurring in one of the keywords later in the list, search does not find it anymore. I wonder whether there is something strange happening when combining the keywords for Lucene's search?\n\nMy current workaround is to copy keywords into the comments and then it seems to work fine.",
        "Best Human Answer":"#Update: It also seems that the new search does not recognise string occurrences in the keywords anymore.\n\nKeywords exhibit the same behaviour as other fields, so you need to add a wildcard to match the beginning of the token to match a target that occurs anywhere other than the beginning of the token. For example, keywords:*abc.\n\nNote: The documentation at https:\/\/lucene.apache.org\/core\/2_9_4\/queryparsersyntax.html states that \"You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.\" but the results in JabRef contradict this. Searching for *abc or ?yz-abc` matches \"xyz-abc\" whether it occurs in the title, keywords, or comment field.\n\nEdit: I am currently using JabRef 6.0--2024-09-25--91d0709"
